Is a word guessing game. Computer thinks of a word, the player guesses it by choosing letters from the alphabet. There are certain amount of guesses - to draw a spaceship. After player guesses the word, they win. If player used all guesses and still not guessed the word, they lose.

 The code is written on VanillaJS meaning that it is plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript. MVC-based architecture.

## Getting Started
Which planet computer guessed for you? Make sure NOT to collect all the UFO components or Aliens will take you on their ship ðŸ‘½

## Some code parts
- Challenging function

This function was challenging for me because it depends on many actions that happen in the game and on the states.
Firstly, I need to check value of used letters and compare it to each letter of computer's guessed word. And regarding of that, show corresponding letters on the screen.
I had a bug with that function in the beginning because I was creating span elements with id of each letter. Because some letters have multiple same letters, they were not showing up because id should be unique :) 

```JS
function renderGuessedWord() {
  guessedWord.forEach((letter, idx) => {
    //check if span with id not exists then create span
    if (!getWordLetterEl(idx)) {
      createChildForParent('span', makeWordLeterElId(idx), currentWordEl);
    }

    if (usedLetters.includes(letter)) {
      getWordLetterEl(idx).innerText = letter;
    } else {
      getWordLetterEl(idx).innerText = '_';
    }
  });

  if (currentWordEl.innerText === currentWord) {
    
    return showMessage('win');
  }
}
```

- Favorite function

I think it is my favorite function because it has a bit of every steps and logic of the game. It is updating some eventual states such as used letters and spaceship components visibility. And it is constantly checking if user entered the correct letter which is not included in the computer's word.
```JS
function makeMove(evt) {
  if (evt.target.tagName !== 'BUTTON') return;
  const letter = evt.target.innerText
  usedLetters.push(letter.toLowerCase());
  // if user clicked the letter that is not included in word, add +1 to the wrongLetter
  if(!guessedWord.includes(letter.toLowerCase())) {
    if (wrongLetter >= Object.keys(spaceship).length) {
      setVisibility(spacemanEl, 'none');
      return showMessage('loss');
    }
    wrongLetter += 1;
  }

  // handle wrong letters
  for (let i = 0; i < wrongLetter;  i++) {
    const objName = Object.keys(spaceship)[i]
    spaceship[objName] = true;
  }

  render();
}
```

## Unique elements
In this project I added some nice graphic elements from Freepik. Freepic is an online resource with a lot of free to use graphics. I added credit links to the bottom of the game page.

## Future improvements
